# Scratchpad

I have a couple ideas for this project. For the MVP I want something minimal, maybe a ok UI and a WASM game with no state and then I proceed to add local state or maybe E2E communication.

My goal is to create a dashboard to display the user's score and the game options, initially a simple snake game built with wasm and then I plan on scaling it into a fullstack app with JWT token possibly RBAC? Not really needed, but might be a nice touch to show expertise, even though it's a very questionable decision.

I just want to scale it up and play with native as much as possible.
