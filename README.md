## About

[**ðŸ“š How to run? ðŸ“š**][usage]

A simple React Native project mixed with Golang for the API and Rust for the WASM implementation. 

The main goal here was to challenge myself with a couple simple concepts that I have the knowledge, such as Auth, API integration, WebAssembly embedding. It's simples, but it's a learning project.

## ðŸš´ Usage

Install the root packages.

```
[package-manager] install
```

Compile the WASM with Rust

```
cd wasm && wasm-pack build --target web && cd ..
```

Spin up the docker

```
cd backend && cp .env.example .env && docker compose up -d && cd ..
```

Run the project

```
[package-manager] run dev
```
